# Issue Indexer

Issue Indexer is a web application designed to help project management via tracking the issues within a project.

## How to use Issue Indexer

First, you're going to need an account - simply follow the registration instructions and your account is set up instantly.
3 different account types are supported; user (standard), manager and administrator. For most situations, a user account suffices, so don't be pressured to think your team needs administrator/manager accounts.

As a user you can:
* create, edit and delete projects (where you're the creator)
* add team members to a project (where you're the creator)
* create, edit and delete your own tickets
* leave comments on tickets
* view all projects you're part of (and all their tickets)

As a manager you can:
* do everything a user can do
* add team members to a project
* add users that you 'manage'
* create, edit and delete projects where you're the manager
* transfer a project to another manager
* view all projects you manage

As an administrator you can:
* do everything a manager can do
* make users into managers (and vice-versa)
* view all projects that all your managers manage

Note: To have an administrator account, contact the Issue Indexer's support team. Standard user accounts suffice for many team work situations.
